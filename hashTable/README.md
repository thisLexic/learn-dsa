1. Write a function that returns the intersection of two arrays. The intersec-
tion is a third array that contains all values contained within the first two
arrays. For example, the intersection of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] is [2, 4] .
Your function should have a complexity of O(N). (If your programming
language has a built-in way of doing this, don’t use it. The idea is to build
the algorithm yourself.)

2. Write a function that accepts an array of strings and returns the first
duplicate value it finds. For example, if the array is ["a", "b", "c", "d", "c", "e",
"f"] , the function should return "c" , since it’s duplicated within the array.
(You can assume that there’s one pair of duplicates within the array.)
Make sure the function has an efficiency of O(N).

3. Write a function that accepts a string that contains all the letters of the
alphabet except one and returns the missing letter. For example, the string,
"the quick brown box jumps over a lazy dog" contains all the letters of the alphabet
except the letter, "f" . The function should have a time complexity of O(N).

4. Write a function that returns the first non-duplicated character in a string.
For example, the string, "minimum" has two characters that only exist
once—the "n" and the "u" , so your function should return the "n" , since it
occurs first. The function should have an efficiency of O(N).
