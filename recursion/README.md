4. Here is an array containing both numbers as well as other arrays, which
in turn contain numbers and arrays:
array = [
1,
2,
3,
[4, 5, 6],
7,
[8,
[9, 10, 11,
[12, 13, 14]
]
],
[15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
[20, 21, 22,
[23, 24, 25,
[26, 27, 29]
], 30, 31
], 32
], 33
]
Write a recursive function that prints all the numbers (and just numbers).

# 11

1. Use recursion to write a function that accepts an array of strings and
returns the total number of characters across all the strings. For example,
if the input array is ["ab", "c", "def", "ghij"] , the output should be 10 since there
are 10 characters in total.

2. Use recursion to write a function that accepts an array of numbers and
returns a new array containing just the even numbers.

3. There is a numerical sequence known as “Triangular Numbers.” The
pattern begins as 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, and continues onward with the Nth
number in the pattern, which is N plus the previous number. For example,
the 7th number in the sequence is 28, since it’s 7 (which is N) plus 21
(the previous number in the sequence). Write a function that accepts a
number for N and returns the correct number from the series. That is, if
the function was passed the number 7, the function would return 28.

4. Use recursion to write a function that accepts a string and returns the
first index that contains the character “x.” For example, the string,
"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" has an “x” at index 23. To keep things simple,
assume the string definitely has at least one “x.”
