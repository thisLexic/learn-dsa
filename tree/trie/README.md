3. Write a function that traverses each node of a trie and prints each key,
including all "*" keys.

4. Write an autocorrect function that attempts to replace a user’s typo with
a correct word. The function should accept a string that represents text
a user typed in. If the user’s string is not in the trie, the function should
return an alternative word that shares the longest possible prefix with
the user’s string.
For example, let’s say our trie contained the words “cat,” “catnap,” and
“catnip.” If the user accidentally types in “catnar,” our function should
return “catnap,” since that’s the word from the trie that shares the longest
prefix with “catnar.” This is because both “catnar” and “catnap” share a
prefix of “catna,” which is five characters long. The word “catnip” isn’t as
good, since it only shares the shorter, four-character prefix of “catn” with
“catnar.”
One more example: if the user types in “caxasfdij,” the function could
return any of the words “cat,” “catnap,” and “catnip,” since they all share
the same prefix of “ca” with the user’s typo.
If the user’s string is found in the trie, the function should just return
the word itself. This should be true even if the user’s text is not a complete
word, as we’re only trying to correct typos, not suggest endings to the
user’s prefix.
