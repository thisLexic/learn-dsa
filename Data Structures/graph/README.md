4. In this chapter, I only provided the code for breadth-first traversal, as
discussed in Breadth-First Search, on page 348. That is, the code simply
printed the value of each vertex. Modify the code so that it performs an
actual search for a vertex value provided to the function. (We did this for
depth-first search.) That is, if the function finds the vertex it’s searching
for, it should return that vertex’s value. Otherwise, it should return null.
